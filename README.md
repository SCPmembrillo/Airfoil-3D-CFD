# Airfoil 3D CFD
## Overview

| Property                                | Wing 1 | Wing 2 |
|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Sweep angle (°)                         | 0      | 15     |
| Taper ratio                             | 1      | 0.3    |
| Aspect ratio                            | 5      | 10     |
| Root chord [m]                          | 1      | 1      |
| Dihedral angle (°)                      | 0      | 0      |

Both wings have a NACA 7715 airfoil at the root and a NACA 0009 at the tip.

## Objectives
- To design and simulate complex three-dimensional wing structures in ANSYS Fluent
- To analyze the effect of wing geometric characteristics on 3D aerodynamics
